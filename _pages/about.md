We started working on Databases Demystified because we wanted to create educational materials about databases that are accessible to tech-adjacent folks who want to learn about this super-important part of computing infrastructure but who don't want to have to get a Computer Science degree to do it.

Our goal is to give you exactly what you need to know about databases to work with and around them effectively: no more, and no less. We focus on practical problems and how these technologies are used in practice without getting into the weeds of the underlying algorithms.

If you have questions, thoughts, or comments, please don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:michael@kaminsky.rocks).
